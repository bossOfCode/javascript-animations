# You're doing great, @{{ user.username }}!
Now, we will make a car.
# Step 2 : add a `background` and `draw function`
You might be wondering, What ***is*** a `draw function`?
> The `draw function` helps us repeatedly draw the picture, so it can be animated. Somewhat like the function in a GIF.
 - [ ] First, navigate to the `index.js` file on the `create-car` branch.
 - [ ] Then add the following code:<br>
   `var myBackground = color(0, 0, 255, 0.5);// You can change the name of the varible`<br>
   `background(myBackground);`<br>
   `draw = function() {`<br>
   `var drawCar = function() {// don't forget 'var'`<br>
   ` ` <br>
   `}` <br>
   `}` <br>
> var stands for varible. Varibles can replace long strings, booleans, and math equations in Prossesing JS.
 - [ ] Last step: push the changes into the `create-car` branch. When I see the push coming through, I'll lead you to the next step!
